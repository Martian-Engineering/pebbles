# Repo Setup

## Git Remote (Martian-Engineering)

If you cloned from another remote or initialized the repo locally, point the
remote at the Martian-Engineering organization:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:Martian-Engineering/pebbles.git
# or if origin already exists:
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Martian-Engineering/pebbles.git
```

Verify:

```bash
git remote -v
```
